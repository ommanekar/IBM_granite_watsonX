AI Brainstorming Buddy is an interactive chatbot-style tool designed to help teams spark creativity during idea generation. It allows users to upload documents in PDF, DOCX, or TXT formats, which are then summarized and used as the base context for creative thinking.

Users can ask questions or enter prompts, and choose between Creative, Diverse, or Lateral thinking modes. Each mode guides the AI to respond differentlyâ€”by offering imaginative, unique, or unconventional ideas. The tool uses IBM Watsonx and Granite foundation models to ensure the output is tailored to the uploaded content.

The interface supports multiple chat sessions, making it ideal for team use. It's built with Streamlit for a simple, clean, and minimal UI.
